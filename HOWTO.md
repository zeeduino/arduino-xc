## Arduino-XC on your microcontroller

### Using the library with already implemented HAL

Check the [LPC1347 Arduino-XC HAL implementation](https://github.com/zeeduino/arduino-xc-lpc13xx) for example of using already implemented
HAL in your project.

In this case it is implementation for NXP LPC1347 micro which is then used with LPCXpresso IDE to create and run Arduino-XC projects.

### Implementing the HAL yourself
