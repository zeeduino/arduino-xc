arduino-xc:

Arduino core classes/functions
Arduino libraries (SPI, Wire, UART, etc)
	References Arduino Core
Arduino contrib libraries (sensors, chips, displays, etc)
	Reference Arduino core and core libs


inc -> Arduino core header files. These DO NOT reference board API functions or include board API headers.
inc/board -> board API specification
inc/lib -> Core Arduino libraries (SPI, Wire, UART, etc)
inc/contrib -> Additional Arduino libraries (sensors, chips, displays, etc)

src -> Arduino core implementation. These DO reference board API functions or include board API headers.
src/lib/xyz -> Core Arduino library class implementation.  These DO reference board API functions or include board API headers.
src/contrib -> Additional Arduino library implementations


--------------------------------------------
arduino-xc-lpc13xx:

Arduino XC board API implementation for LPC13xx variant
Uses Arduino Core headers (board API)
Headers from here ("board_private.h" and "pins_arduino.h") should be NEVER included directly by sketches if you want them to be portable.

inc -> contains "board_private.h" and "pins_arduino.h": variant specific definitions used by board API implementation files (src, src/inc)
src -> pin mapping functions, pins_arduino implementation(s), variant.cpp with initVariant() and yield() implementation
src/board -> board API implementation

=============================================

Sketch should ONLY include core or lib headers
Sketch project should reference arduino-xc project and arduino-xc-variant project with any additional, chip specific libraries/projects

New Arduino contrib library should only reference core, or other Arduino libraries header files.
All and any necessary variant (i.e. lpc13xx) header files should be referenced by "variant.h"
