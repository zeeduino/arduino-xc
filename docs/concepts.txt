inc -> Zeeduino core header files. These DO NOT reference board API functions or include board API headers.
inc/board -> board API specification
inc/lib -> Core Zeeduino libraries (SPI, Wire, UART, USB, etc)

src -> Zeeduino core implementation. These DO reference board API functions or include board API headers.
src/lib/xyz -> Core Zeeduino library class implementation.  These DO reference board API functions or include board API headers.


--------------------------------------------
zeeduino-xc-lpc13xx:

Zeeduino XC board API implementation for LPC13xx variant
Uses Zeeduino Core headers (board API)
Headers from here ("board_private.h" and "pins_arduino.h") should be NEVER included directly by sketches if you want them to be portable.

inc -> contains "board_private.h" and "pins_arduino.h": variant specific definitions used by board API implementation files (src, src/inc)
src -> pin mapping functions, pins_arduino implementation(s), variant.cpp with initVariant() and yield() implementation
src/board -> board API implementation

=============================================

Sketch should ONLY include core or lib headers

New Arduino contrib library should only reference core, or other Arduino libraries header files.
All and any necessary variant (i.e. lpc13xx) header files should be referenced by "variant.h"
